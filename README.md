# MyPortfolio â€“ Personal Developer Website

**Live at:** [fcampoverdeg.dev](https://fcampoverdeg.dev)

This is the source code for my personal portfolio â€“ a fully custom-built React + Node.js application that showcases my work across embedded systems, web development, robotics, and interactive UI/UX design.

The website reflects who I am not only as a developer, but as a designer, engineer, and creator.

This portfolio is:

- A modern **single-page application (SPA)** using React
- **Fully responsive**, built mobile-first
- Designed with **clean visuals**, subtle animations, and clear structure

Each project page includes rich interactions, including 3D models, image galleries, and scroll-triggered animations.
