            <p className="overview-description">
              <strong>CroQuest</strong> is a custom-built handheld console
              powered by an ESP32, featuring an 8-bit parallel TFT screen, SD
              card storage, audio output, and Bluetooth multiplayer. The entire
              system: hardware, firmware, and enclosure was developed from
              scratch and includes a modular game engine, custom UI, badge
              unlock system, and a library of games like Snake, Tic Tac Toe,
              Simon, Pong, and Tetris. All with built-in BLE multiplayer
              support.

              Bluetooth multiplayer and game engine frameworks.

            <p>
              This project taught me valuable lessons in embedded systems
              programming, state synchronization over BLE, and the importance of
              aligning physical design with software architecture. It was also
              my first time integrating multiplayer logic with custom Bluetooth
              protocols.
